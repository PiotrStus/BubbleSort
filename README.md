### Bubble Sort Algorithm

The Bubble Sort Algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass-through is repeated until the list is sorted.

#### How it works:

1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare each pair of adjacent elements.
3. If they are in the wrong order, swap them.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until no swaps are needed, indicating the list is sorted.

#### Used technologies: 
- C#

#### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant space complexity.

#### Usage:

Bubble Sort can be used for educational purposes or for small datasets. However, it's not suitable for large datasets due to its inefficiency.
